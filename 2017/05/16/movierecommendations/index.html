  <h2><a href="http://paulgarias.github.io/2017/05/16/movierecommendations/">Movie recommendations with Machine Learning</a></h2>

  <p>One of the challenges in recommending new products for a consumer to purchase is that we don't often have a way to deducing what a person tastes are. In order to get a good understanding of what movie recommendations an individual may like, we often have to understand how similar a movie, or a group of movies that were viewed by an individual are, and provide recommendations of these similiarities with the entire gamut of selections in our list.</p> 
  <p>There are a few ways of providing recommendations of products. One the one hand, we can try to match certain characteristics about items that a consumer bought and then try to compare similar characteristics. Another way is to see if there are similar products bought by two unique users and compare the items that they bought. If the similarity between the purchases of a consumer match within a threshold, then we can suggest an item to one of the consumers that they had not yet bought.</p>

  <h3> Jupyter Notebook </h3>
  <p> Attached is a Jupyter Notebook it includes the step by step process of how I broke down the problem of updating the new stock value sheet. This requires keeping an eye on the current stock portfolio valuation (what are the stocks/values/shares that you are holding now). To automate this process, I simply create a cron job that runs the script at 7AM Eastern Time.</p>
